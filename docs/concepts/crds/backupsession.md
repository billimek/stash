# BackupSession

## What is BackupSession

A `BackupSession` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)` which represents a backup instance of the respective target pointed by a `BackupConfiguration` in Kubernetes native way.

When a backup schedule appears, respective `CronJob` creates a `BackupSession` object. It points to the respective `BackupConfiguration`. Controller that run inside backup sidecar (in case of backup through job it is stash operator itself) watches this `BackupSession` object and start taking backup instantly.

You can also create a `BackupSession` object manually to trigger backup instantly.

>In this tutorial, we are going to use **host** word to indicate an entity (pod) whose data is backed up.
>- For `Deployment`, `ReplicationController` and `ReplicaSet`, backup process run in only one pod. This pod is referred as **host-0**.
>- For `StatefulSet`, backup process run in all pods. In this case, **pod-0** is known as **host-0**, **pod-1** is known as **host-1**, **pod-2** is known as **host-2** and so on.
>- For `DaemonSet`, backup process run in all daemon pods. In this case, the **node name** where the pod is running act as their **host** name.
>- For database or stand alone PVC, backup is done by a job. In this case, backup job's pod is known as **host-0**.

## BackupSession CRD Specification

Like other official Kubernetes resources, `BackupSession` has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta` and `Spec` , `Status` sections.

A sample `BackupSession` created for backing up a Deployment's data is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: BackupSession
metadata:
  name: deployment-backup-2do7af
  namespace: demo
  labels:
    backup-configuration: deployment-backup
spec:
  backupConfiguration:
    name: deployment-backup
status:
  phase: Succeeded
  totalHosts: 1
  sessionDuration: 3.861369766s
  stats:
  - hostname: host-0
    phase: Succeeded
    duration: 3.861369766s
    snapshots:
    - directory: /source/data
      fileStats:
        modifiedFiles: 0
        newFiles: 0
        totalFiles: 2
        unmodifiedFiles: 2
      name: ea5381cc
      processingTime: 0m0s
      size: 30 B
      uploaded: 0 B
```

Here, we are going to describe some important sections of `BackupSession` CRD.

### BackupSession `Metadata` Section

#### metadata.name

`metadata.name` indicates the name of the `BackupSession`. This name is automatically generated by respective `CronJob` and it follows following pattern: `<BackupConfiguration name>-<random suffix>`.

#### metadata.namespace

`metadata.namespace` indicates the name of the `BackupSession`. It is same as namespace of respective `BackupConfiguration` object.

#### metadata.labels

`metadata.labels` holds respective `BackupConfiguration` name as label. Stash backup sidecar container use this label to watch only the BackupSessions of that `BackupConfiguration`.

### BackupSession `Spec` Section

BackupSession object has following fields in `.spec` section:

#### spec.backupConfiguration

`spec.backupConfiguration.name` indicates the name of the `BackupConfiguration` object whose target will be triggered to take backup instantly by this `BackupSession`.

### BackupSession `Status` Section

`.status` section of `BackupSession` shows progress, stats and overall phase of backup process in this session. Backup sidecar container or job update their respective filed of this `.status` after they complete their task. `.status` section consist of following fields:

#### status.phase

`status.phase` indicates the overall phase of the backup process for this BackupSession. `status.phase` will be `Succeeded` only if phase of all hosts are `Succeeded`. If any of the hosts fail to complete backup, `status.phase` will be `Failed`.

#### status.totalHosts

A `BackupSession` may trigger backup of multiple hosts. For example, all the pod's of a `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet` and `ReplicationController` mounts same volume. In this case, Stash will backup data only from one pod. Thus, total number of hosts for these workloads will be 1. On the other hand, pods of `StatefulSet` and `DaemonSet` may have different volume mounted into different replica. In this case, Stash will backup data from all individual pods. Thus, total number of hosts for these workloads will be number of replicas for `StatefulSet` and number of running daemon pods for `DaemonSet`.

#### status.sessionDuration

`status.sessionDuration` indicates total time taken to complete backup of all hosts in this session. It is simply the sum of backup duration of all individual hosts.

#### status.stats

`status.stats` section is an array of backup statistics of individual hosts. Each hosts add their statistics in this array after completing their backup process.

Individual host stats entry consist of following fields:

- **hostname :** `hostname` indicates name of the host.
- **phase :** `phase` indicates backup phase of this host.
- **duration :** `duration` indicates total time taken to complete backup for this host.
- **snapshots :** Stash creates one snapshot for each target directories specified in `spec.target.directories` field of `BackupConfiguration` object. `snapshots` field holds statistics of each of these individual snapshots. Each snapshot statistics has following fields:
  - **name :** `name` indicates the name of the snapshot.
  - **directory :** `directory` indicates the directory that was backed up in this snapshot.
  - **size :** `size` indicates the size of data to backup from this directory.
  - **uploaded :** `uploaded` indicates size of data that was uploaded to backend for this snapshot. This could be much more smaller than `size` if some data was already uploaded in the backend in previous backup session.
  - **processingTime :** `processingTime` indicates time taken to process the data of target directory.
  - **fileStats :** `fileStats` field show statics of files that was backed up in this snapshot.
    - **totalFiles :** `totalFiles` shows total number of files that was backed up in this snapshot.
    - **newFiles :** `newFiles` shows number of new files that was backed up in this snapshot.
    - **modifiedFiles :** `modifiedFiles` shows number of files that was modified since last backup of this directory.
    - **unmodifiedFiles :** `unmodifiedFiles` shows number of files that hasn't been changed since last backup of this directory.
- **error :** `error` shows the reason of failure if backup process fail for this host.
