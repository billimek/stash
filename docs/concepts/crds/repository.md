# Repository

## What is Repository

A `Repository` is a Kubernetes `CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)` which represent [backend](/docs/guides/backends/overview.md) information in Kubernetes native way.

Users have to create a `Repository` object for each backup target. `Repository` object has 1-1 mapping with the target. Thus, only one target can be backed up into one `Repository`.

## Repository CRD Specification

Like other official Kubernetes resources, `Repostiory` object has `TypeMeta`, `ObjectMeta`, `Spec` and `Status` sections. A sample `Repository` object that holds backup information of a GCS bucket is shown below,

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-demo-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-demo-backup
      prefix: demo
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
  wipeOut: false
status:
  firstBackupTime: "2019-04-15T06:08:16Z"
  integrity: true
  lastBackupTime: "2019-04-15T06:14:15Z"
  size: 2.567 KiB
  snapshotCount: 5
  snapshotRemovedOnLastCleanup: 1
```

Here, we are going to describe some important sections of `Repository` CRD.

### Repository `Spec` Section

`Repository` CRD holds the following information in `.spec` section.

#### spec.backend

`spec.backend` holds the backend information where the backed up snapshots will be stored. To learn how to configure `Repository` crd for  various backends, please visit [here](/docs/guides/backends/overview.md).

#### backend prefix/subPath

`prefix` of any backend denotes the directory inside the backend where the backed up snapshots are being stored. In case of **Local** backend, `subPath` is used for this purpose.

#### spec.wipeOut

As the name implies, `spec.wipeOut` field indicates whether Stash should delete respective backed up files from the backend when `Repository` crd is deleted. The default value of this field is `false` that tell Stash not to delete backed up data when the user deletes `Repository` crd.

### Repository `Status` Section

Stash operator updates `.status` of a Repository CRD every time a backup operation is completed.

`Repository` crd shows following statistics in status section:

#### status.firstBackupTime

`status.firstBackupTime` indicates the timestamp when the first backup was taken.

#### status.lastBackupTime

`status.lastBackupTime` indicates the timestamp when the latest backup was taken.

#### status.integrity

Stash checks the integrity of backed up files after each backup. `status.integrity` shows result of the integrity check.

#### status.size

`status.size` shows the total size of repository after last backup.

#### status.snapshotCount

`status.SnapshotCount` shows the number of snapshots stored in the repository.

#### status.snapshotRemovedOnLastCleanup

`status.snapshotRemovedOnLastCleanup` shows the number of old snapshots cleaned up according to retention policy on last backup session.

## Deleting Repository

Stash allows the users to delete **only `Repository` crd** or **`Repository` crd with respective backed up data**. Here, we are going to show how to perform these delete operations.

**Delete only `Repository` keeping backed up data:**

 You can delete only `Repository` crd by,

```console
$ kubectl delete repository <repository-name>

# Example
$ kubectl delete repository gcs-demo-repo
repository "gcs-demo-repo" deleted
```

This will delete only `Repository` crd. It won't delete any backed up data from the backend.

>If you delete `Repository` crd while respective stash sidecar still exists on the workload, it will fail to take further backup.

**Delete `Repostiory` along with backed up data:**

In order to prevent the users from accidentally deleting backed up data, Stash uses a special `wipeOut` flag in `spec` section of `Repository` crd. By default, this flag is set to `wipeOut: false`. If you want to delete respective backed up data from backend while deleting `Repository` crd, you must set this flag to `wipeOut: true`.

> Currently, Stash does not support wiping out backed up data for local backend. If you want to cleanup backed up data from local backend, you must do it manually.

Here, is an example of deleting backed up data from GCS backend,

- First, set `wipeOut: true` by patching `Repository` crd.

  ```console
  $ kubectl patch repository gcs-demo-repo --type="merge" --patch='{"spec": {"wipeOut": true}}'
  repository "gcs-demo-repo" patched
  ```

- Finally, delete `Repository` object. It will delete backed up data from the backend.

  ```console
  $ kubectl delete repository gcs-demo-repo
  repository "gcs-demo-repo" deleted
  ```

You can browse your backend storage bucket to verify that the backed up data has been deleted.
